## Notes 5
### Networking & Content Delivery
1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It is a reference model that specifies standards for communications protocols and also the functionalities of each layer.
     - The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. 
2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
   - Two quotes I found interesting were "An elastic network interface (referred to as a network interface in this documentation) is a virtual network interface that can include the following attributes:
     a primary private IPv4 address." and "A network interface's attributes follow it as it is attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance."
     - I found these quotes interesting, the first quote tells us what a virtual network can include and the second quote informs us of the attributes that are following/detached.
3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
   - Each instance in your VPC has a default network interface (the primary network interface) that is assigned a private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC.
     - You cannot detach a primary network interface from an instance. You can create and attach an additional network interface to any instance in your VPC.
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - Not much, I felt like I learned a lot from this section and readings/ videos.
