##Notes 8
###Databases
1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - A database is a shared collection of related data used to support the activities of a particular organization.
     - A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain databases and control all access to them.
       - A database is designed, built and populated with data for a specific purpose.
2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
   - Two quotes I found interesting were "A database system is referred to as self-describing because it not only contains the database itself, but also metadata which defines
     and describes the data and relationships between tables in the database." and "In the file-based system, the structure of the data files is defined in the application programs so
     if a user wants to change the structure of a file, all the programs that access that file might need to be changed as well."
     - I found these quotes interesting, the first quote informs us about how a database is referred as. While the second quote explains the file-based system within the databases.
3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
   - In the database approach, the data structure is stored in the system catalogue and not in the programs.
     - Current database systems are designed for multiple users. That is, they allow many users to access the same database at the same time.
       - A database supports multiple views of data.  A view is a subset of the database, which is defined and dedicated for particular users of the system.
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - Not much, I felt like I learned a lot from this section and readings/ videos.
