## Notes 2
### Cloud Economics and Billing
 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
    - With a traditional infrastructure, the components—like datacenters, data storage, and other equipment—are all managed and owned by the business within their own facilities.
      - Cloud infrastructure describes the components and resources needed for cloud computing. You can create a private cloud by building it yourself using resources dedicated solely to you.
      - TCO extends beyond just the initial purchase price or implementation costs and account for the full cost of an asset over its life, which aren’t always reflected in upfront pricing.
 2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
    - Two quotes I found interesting were "One of the main benefits of cloud services is the ability it gives you to optimize costs to match your needs, even as those needs change." and "AWS offers on-demand,
      pay-as-you-go, and reservation-based payment models, enabling you to obtain the best return on your investment for each specific use case."
      - I found these quotes interesting the first quote informs us about the the beenfits cloud services has about payments and the second quote also explains the type of payments we can have.
 3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
    - Information technology (IT) infrastructure are the components required to operate and manage enterprise IT environments.
      - Amazon EC2 has limits on both the type of instance you can use, and how many hours you can use in one month.
 4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
    - Not much, I felt like I learned a lot from this section and readings/ videos.
