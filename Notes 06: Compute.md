## Notes 6
### Compute
1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - Your computer's operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer.
     - An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware.
       - A GUI lets you use your mouse to click icons, buttons, and menus, and everything is clearly displayed on the screen using a combination of graphics and text.
2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
   - Two quotes I found interesting were "Linux (pronounced LINN-ux) is a family of open-source operating systems, which means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world" and
     "Collect compute-related metrics: One of the best ways to understand how your compute systems are performing is to record and track the true utilization of various resources."
     - I found these quotes interesting because the first quote tells us the way Linux functions and the second quote informs us on how collecting metrics is priority.
3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
   - Use the available elasticity of resources: The cloud provides the flexibility to expand or reduce your resources dynamically through a variety of mechanisms to meet changes in demand.
     - Containers are a method of operating system virtualization that allow you to run an application and its dependencies in resource-isolated processes.
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - Not much, I felt like I learned a lot from this section and readings/ videos.
