## Notes 1
### Cloud Concepts Overview
1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - Cloud computing is a specialized form of distributed computing that introduces utilization models for reamotely provisioning scalable and measured resources.
     -  It is important to distinguish the term "cloud" and the cloud symbol from the internet. As a specific environment used to remotely provision IT resources, a cloud has a finite boundary. There are many individual clouds that are accessible via the internet.
       - A cloud's measured usage characteristics represents a feature set that allows measured operational/ expenditures (directly related to business performance) to replace anticipated capital expenditures. This is also refined to asproportional couts.
2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
   - Two quotes I found interesting were "Much of the Internet is dedicated to the access of content-based IT resources published via the World Wide Web." and "IT resources provided by cloud environments on the other hand, are dedicated to supplying back-end processing capabilities and user-based access to these capabilities."
     - I found these quotes interesting the first quote tells us how important IT resources are to the internet also known as "World Wide Web" and "Ethernet", the second quote was interesting because it demonstrates shortly how the cloud supplies with processing capabilities, and it also being user-based.
3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
   - Another key distinction is that it is not necessary for clouds to be web-based even if they are commanly based on the internet protocols and technologies.
     - An IT resource is a phsyical or virtual IT related artifact that can be either sfotware based, such as a vrtiual server or a custom software program, or hardware based, like a physical server or a network device.
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - Not much, I felt like I learned a lot from this section and readings/ videos.
