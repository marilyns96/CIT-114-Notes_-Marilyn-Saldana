### Cloud Architecture
1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - A well-architected workload uses the most cost-effective resources, which can have a significant and positive economic impact.
     - AWS offers a variety of flexible and cost-effective pricing options to acquire instances from Amazon EC2 and other services in a way that best fits your needs.
2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
   - Two quotes I found interesting were "In AWS, you can automatically provision resources to match the workload demand." and " Auto Scaling using demand or time-based
     approaches allow you to add and remove resources as needed."
     - I found these two quotes interesting because, quote one lets us know how important the resources are while quote two informs us about the benefits of Auto Scaling.
3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
   - As AWS releases new services and features, it's a best practice to review your existing architectural decisions to ensure they continue to be the most cost effective.
     - Sustainability in the cloud is a continuous effort focused primarily on energy reduction and efficiency across all components of a workload by achieving the maximum benefit
       from the resources provisioned and minimizing the total resources required.
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - No questions remain in my mind after this module course.
