#CIT 114
## Notes 7
### Storage
1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - Volatile memory is a type of storage whose contents are erased when the system's power is turned off or interrupted.
     - As the computer boots, parts of the operating system and drivers are loaded into memory (RAM), which allows the CPU to process the instructions faster and speeds up the boot process.
2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
   - Two quotes I found interesting were "A computer's performance is largely attributed to the amount of memory contained within it. If a computer does not have the recommended memory to run 
     the operating system and software programs being used." and "The SSD uses less power than a standard HDD, which means a lower energy bill over time and for laptops, an increase in battery life."
     - I found these quotes interesting the first quote tells us the peformance of the memory inside a computer and the second quote lets us know the pros of a SSD.
3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
   - The HDD has moving parts and magnetic platters, meaning the more use they get, the faster they wear down and fail.
     - 	With the spinning platters and moving read/write heads, an HDD can sometimes be one of the loudest components in your computer.
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - Not much, I felt like I learned a lot from this section and readings/ videos.
