## Notes 4
### AWS Cloud Security
1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - The AWS infrastructure has been designed to provide an extremely scalable, highly reliable platform that enables customers to deploy applications and data quickly and securely.
     - This infrastructure is built and managed not only according to security best practices and standards, but also with the unique needs of the cloud in mind.
     - AWS operates under a shared security responsibility model, where AWS is responsible for the security of the underlying cloud infrastructure and you are responsible for securing workloads you deploy in AWS
2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
   - Two quotes I found interesting were "Network firewalls built into Amazon VPC let you create private networks and control access to your instances or applications. Customers can control encryption in transit with TLS across AWS services."
     and "Connectivity options that enable private, or dedicated, connections from your office or on-premises environment."
     - I found these quotes interesting the first quote informs us how manageable AWS Cloud can be to access your applications and user control encryption with the AWS services. The second quote lets us know the difference and change the connectiviity options
       they have implemeneted.
3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
   - Automatic encryption of all traffic on the AWS global and regional networks between AWS secured facilities.
     - Flexible key management options, including AWS Key Management Service, that allow you to choose whether to have AWS manage the encryption keys or enable you to keep complete control over your own keys.
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - Not much, I felt like I learned a lot from this section and readings/ videos.
