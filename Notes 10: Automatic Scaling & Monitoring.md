## Notes 10
### Automatic Scaling & Monitoring
1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
   - Load balancing is the practice of distributing computational workloads between two or more computers.
     - On the Internet, load balancing is often employed to divide network traffic among several servers.
       - Load balancing essentially accomplishes the same thing. By dividing user requests among multiple servers, user wait time is vastly cut down.
2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
   - Two quotes I found interesting were, "Load balancing is handled by a tool or application called a load balancer. A load balancer can be either hardware-based or software-based." 
     and "When a request arrives from a user, the load balancer assigns the request to a given server, and this process repeats for each request."
     - I found these quotes interesting because, they inform us of the benefits load balancers provide in hardware, and software.
3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section?
   - Load balancers determine which server should handle each request based on a number of different algorithms. These algorithms fall into two main categories: static and dynamic.
     - Static load balancing algorithms distribute workloads without taking into account the current state of the system. 
       - Dynamic load balancing algorithms take the current availability, workload, and health of each server into account.
4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
   - No questions remain in my mind I learned enough with the readings and videos.
